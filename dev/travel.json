            "ans": "Itâ€™s best to bring both cash in Hong Kong dollars and credit cards. Most shops in Hong Kong accept major credit cards; however, at open-air markets, most vendors will only take cash. Also note that the taxis only accept cash."

            "q": "Will I be able to use my electrical equipment in Hong Kong?",
            "ans": "The standard electrical voltage in Hong Kong is 220 volts AC, 50Hz. Most hotel bathrooms also have outlets for 100 volts, but if not, you will need a transformer for any appliance or electrical equipment. The majority of electrical outlets in Hong Kong take a three-pronged UK-style plug. You can buy an inexpensive adaptor for your electrical equipment at most convenience stores."
