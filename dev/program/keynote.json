            "title":"Future Hybrid Circuits for Functionality, Performance and Energy Efficiency",
            "abstract": "Advances in photonics, flexible electronics, emerging memories, etc. and Si electronics’ integration with these devices have enabled new classes of integrated circuits and systems with enhanced functionality, higher performance, or lower power consumption. Driving greater integration of such heterogeneous hybrid chips/systems can facilitate the continued proliferation of low-cost micro-/nano-systems for a wide range of applications. However, achieving their large-scale integration will require design ecosystem and design automation tools/methodologies much like those that enabled electronic integration in previous decades.<br><br>In this talk, I will briefly introduce two recent Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, on Integrated Photonics and on Flexible Hybrid Electronics respectively, and a research center on developing 3D Hybrid CMOS-memristor circuits, which bring together academia, industry, and government partners to increase design and manufacturing competitiveness in these areas. I will then describe some of our recent results and highlight the needs, challenges and opportunities in these areas.",

			"title":"Self-Awareness for Heterogeneous MPSoCs: A Case Study using Adaptive, Reflective Middleware",
            "photo_path":"img/speaker_photo/nikil_dutt.jpg",
            "abstract":"Self-awareness has a long history in biology, psychology, medicine, engineering and (more recently) computing. In the past decade this has inspired new self-aware strategies for emerging computing substrates (e.g., complex heterogeneous MPSoCs) that must cope with the (often conflicting) challenges of resiliency, energy, heat, cost, performance, security, etc. in the face of highly dynamic operational behaviors and environmental conditions.  Earlier we had championed the concept of CyberPhysical-Systems-on-Chip (CPSoC), a new class of sensor-actuator rich many-core computing platforms that intrinsically couples on-chip and cross-layer sensing and actuation to enable self-awareness. Unlike traditional MPSoCs, CPSoC is distinguished by an intelligent co-design of the control, communication, and computing (C3) system that interacts with the physical environment in real-time in order to modify the system’s behavior so as to adaptively achieve desired objectives and Quality-of-Service (QoS). The CPSoC design paradigm enables self-awareness (i.e., the ability of the system to observe its own internal and external behaviors such that it is capable of making judicious decision) and (opportunistic) adaptation using the concept of cross-layer physical and virtual sensing and actuations applied across different layers of the hardware/software system stack. The closed loop control used for adaptation to dynamic variation -- commonly known as the observe-decide-act (ODA) loop -- is implemented using an adaptive, reflective middleware layer.<br><br>In this talk I will present a case study of this adaptive, reflective middleware layer using a holistic approach for performing resource allocation decisions and power management by leveraging concepts from reflective software. Reflection enables dynamic adaptation based on both external feedback and introspection (i.e., self-assessment). In our context, this translates into performing resource management actuation considering both sensing information (e.g., readings from performance counters, power sensors, etc.) to assess the current system state, as well as models to predict the behavior of other system components before performing an action. I will summarize results leveraging our adaptive-reflective middleware toolchain to i) perform energy-efficient task mapping on heterogeneous architectures, ii) explore the design space of novel HMP architectures, and iii) extend the lifetime of mobile devices.",

            "abstract":"Shopping is widely considered as a relaxing leisure activity. However, grocery shopping can be a frustrating experience for those with visual impairment. While getting to a grocery shop itself is not as much of a challenge for them, locating and picking the items in the grocery shelf becomes a task as challenging as picking a needle from the haystack. Imagine picking up five items for your dinner recipe from a typical grocery store in the US that carries around 35,000 unique items and can have more than 30 aisles spanning 45,000 square meters. This talk will showcase synergistic advances in algorithms, architectures and interface design for assisting those with visual impairment to do shopping. The talk will focus on multiple energy-efficient solutions that consider the battery life time of the vision system.",
