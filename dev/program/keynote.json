To obtain high performance and low power on multicores, co-design of hardware and software is essential. Especially architecture supports for parallelizing and power reducing compiler are very important. This talk first introduces a parallelizing, memory usage optimizing and power reducing compiler and its performance on various multicores from Intel, IBM, arm, Fujitsu, Infineon, and Renesas for various applications including multimedia, automobile, cancer treatment, and earthquake simulation. It next explains architecture supports for the compiler, such as, global address space, data and group barrier synchronization, vector accelerators, data transfer controllers, and power control using DVFS and Clock and Power Gating. The hardware and software co-design allows us not only high performance and low power but also short development period and low development cost of parallel software. ",

            "photo_path": "img/speaker_photo/nikil_dutt.jpg",
            "abstract": "Self-awareness has a long history in biology, psychology, medicine, engineering and (more recently) computing. In the past decade this has inspired new self-aware strategies for emerging computing substrates (e.g., complex heterogeneous MPSoCs) that must cope with the (often conflicting) challenges of resiliency, energy, heat, cost, performance, security, etc. in the face of highly dynamic operational behaviors and environmental conditions.  Earlier we had championed the concept of CyberPhysical-Systems-on-Chip (CPSoC), a new class of sensor-actuator rich many-core computing platforms that intrinsically couples on-chip and cross-layer sensing and actuation to enable self-awareness. Unlike traditional MPSoCs, CPSoC is distinguished by an intelligent co-design of the control, communication, and computing (C3) system that interacts with the physical environment in real-time in order to modify the system’s behavior so as to adaptively achieve desired objectives and Quality-of-Service (QoS). The CPSoC design paradigm enables self-awareness (i.e., the ability of the system to observe its own internal and external behaviors such that it is capable of making judicious decision) and (opportunistic) adaptation using the concept of cross-layer physical and virtual sensing and actuations applied across different layers of the hardware/software system stack. The closed loop control used for adaptation to dynamic variation -- commonly known as the observe-decide-act (ODA) loop -- is implemented using an adaptive, reflective middleware layer.<br><br>In this talk I will present a case study of this adaptive, reflective middleware layer using a holistic approach for performing resource allocation decisions and power management by leveraging concepts from reflective software. Reflection enables dynamic adaptation based on both external feedback and introspection (i.e., self-assessment). In our context, this translates into performing resource management actuation considering both sensing information (e.g., readings from performance counters, power sensors, etc.) to assess the current system state, as well as models to predict the behavior of other system components before performing an action. I will summarize results leveraging our adaptive-reflective middleware toolchain to i) perform energy-efficient task mapping on heterogeneous architectures, ii) explore the design space of novel HMP architectures, and iii) extend the lifetime of mobile devices.",

In this talk, we will analyze several challenges facing the AI community for mapping DNNs to hardware accelerators.

Although FPGAs can provide desirable customized hardware solutions, they are difficult to program and optimize.  We will present a series of effective design techniques for implementing DNNs on FPGAs with high performance and energy efficiency. These include automated hardware/software co-design, the use of configurable DNN IPs, resource allocation across DNN layers, smart pipeline scheduling, Winograd and FFT techniques, and DNN reduction and re-training. We showcase several design solutions including Long-term Recurrent Convolution Network (LRCN) for video captioning, Inception module (GoogleNet) for face recognition, as well as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for sound recognition.

            "abstract": "Security has become a critical design challenge for modern electronic hardware. With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) regime that promises exciting new applications from smart cities to connected autonomous vehicles, security has come to the forefront of the system design process. Recent discoveries and reports on numerous security attacks on microchips and circuits violate the well-regarded concept of hardware trust anchors. It has prompted system designers to develop wide array of design-for-security and test/validation solutions to achieve high security assurance for electronic hardware, which supports the software stack. At the same time, emerging security issues and countermeasures have also led to interesting interplay between security, verification, and interoperability. Verification of hardware for security and trust at different levels of abstraction is rapidly becoming an integral part of the system design flow. The global economic trend that promotes outsourcing of design and fabrication process to untrusted facilities coupled with the prevalent practice of system on chip design using untrusted 3rd party intellectual property blocks (IPs), has given rise to the critical need of trust verification of IPs, system-on-chip design, and fabricated chips.
