                <p class="text-justify">The Symposium explores emerging trends and novel ideas and concepts covering a broad range of topics in the area of VLSI: from VLSI circuits, systems and design methods, to system level design and system-on-chip issues, to bringing VLSI methods to new areas and technologies like nano- and molecular devices, hardware security, etc.  Future design methodologies are also one of the key topics at the Symposium, as well as new EDA tools to support them. Over three decades the Symposium has been a unique forum promoting multidisciplinary research and new visionary approaches in the area of VLSI, bringing together leading scientists and researchers from academia and industry. Selected high quality papers from ISVLSI 2018 will be considered for two Journal Special Issues: 1) IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology (impact factor 2.485), and 2) IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine (impact factor 1.153). The Symposium has established a reputation in bringing together well-known international scientists as invited speakers; the emphasis on high quality will continue at this and future editions of the Symposium.</p>

                The Symposium Program will include contributed papers and speakers invited by the Program Committee as well as a poster session. The keynotes, special sessions and Student Research Forum are planned as well. Authors are invited to submit full-length, original, unpublished papers. To enable blind review, <strong>the author list should be omitted</strong> from the main document. Initial submissions to the conference are limited to <strong>six pages</strong> in PDF format.</p>
