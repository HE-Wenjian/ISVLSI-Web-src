                <p class="text-justify">The Symposium explores emerging trends and novel ideas and concepts covering a broad range of topics in the area of VLSI: from VLSI circuits, systems and design methods, to system level design and system-on-chip issues, to bringing VLSI methods to new areas and technologies like nano- and molecular devices, hardware security, etc. Future design methodologies are also one of the key topics at the Symposium, as well as new EDA tools to support them. Over three decades the Symposium has been a unique forum promoting multidisciplinary research and new visionary approaches in the area of VLSI, bringing together leading scientists and researchers from academia and industry. The conference proceedings will be indexed in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Selected high quality papers from ISVLSI 2018 will be further considered for two Journal Special Issues: 1) IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology (impact factor 2.485), and 2) IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine (impact factor 1.153). The Symposium has established a reputation in bringing together well-known international scientists as invited speakers; the emphasis on high quality will continue at this and future editions of the Symposium. </p>
